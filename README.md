From the Admin Panel of osTicket, we can add departments, designate separate roles within these departments, create new agent profiles of the individuals that hold these roles, and include specific teams to help assign work. We can also create certain permissions to be given to specific roles within the department such as assigning tickets or releasing the ticket assignment.
